# Sabrina_ Portfolio

# [Project 1: SECOM Analytics & Machine Learning (Ongoing)](https://github.com/sasa1021/portfolio/blob/main/Secom)
- Implemented data mining of the semiconductor industry dataset (SECOM) with 590 features. 
- Interpreted and cleaned the data, and applied dimensionality reduction, preprocessing, visualization, and feature selection.
- Developed and evaluated multiple models to predict PASS or FAIL outcomes for wafers
- Aiming to reduce process costs and enhance production efficiency.


 
 # [Project 2: Neural Network Image Processing Project](https://github.com/sasa1021/portfolio/blob/main/Neural%20Network%20Image%20Processing%20Project)
- Utilized Albumentations to address limited data
- converted color labels tocategorical pixels for image segmentation, and used a "ResNet34" preprocessed input
- Choose the UNet model to resolve spatial issues in the original autoencoder
- Defined activation functions, loss functions, and metrics
- Trained the model for 100 epochs
- Achieved a high IoU on the test set and accurately located and outlined roof positions and shapes in satellite cloud images
