# [Project 1: SECOM Analytics & Machine Learning (Ongoing)](https://github.com/sasa1021/portfolio/blob/main/Secom)
- Implemented data mining of the semiconductor industry dataset (SECOM) with 590 features. 
- Interpreted and cleaned the data, and applied dimensionality reduction, preprocessing, visualization, and feature selection.
- Developed and evaluated multiple models to predict PASS or FAIL outcomes for wafers
- Aiming to reduce process costs and enhance production efficiency.


 
 
# [Project 2: Neural Network Image Processing Project](https://github.com/sasa1021/portfolio/blob/main/Neural%20Network%20Image%20Processing%20Project)
- Utilized Albumentations to address limited data
- converted color labels tocategorical pixels for image segmentation, and used a "ResNet34" preprocessed input
- Choose the UNet model to resolve spatial issues in the original autoencoder
- Defined activation functions, loss functions, and metrics
- Trained the model for 100 epochs
- Achieved a high IoU on the test set and accurately located and outlined roof positions and shapes in satellite cloud images

# [Project 3: World Top 200 Swimmer Analytics project](https://github.com/sasa1021/portfolio/blob/main/World%20Top%20200%20swimmer%20project)
- Defined 10 KPIs based on the correlation between various variables
- Preprocessed, Calculated, Visualized and analyzed performance data of the top 200 swimmers worldwide across various strokes and distances in international competitions  
since the 1980s


# [Project 4: OBETA Warehousing Analytics Project](https://github.com/sasa1021/portfolio/blob/main/OBETA%20Warehousing%20Analytics%20Project)
- Created a "snowflake" schema to analyze and define the relationships among variables in a vast warehouse order and picking dataset
- Identified and resolved data quality issues
- Utilized SQL for ETL processes
- Calculated KPIs using R
- Visualized real-time warehouse status using Tableau
- Provided risk identification and improvement recommendations
