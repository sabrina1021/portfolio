# portfolio
This portfolio contains three projects, which are described in detail in the "Read me" file.

1. Analysis of the top 200 swimmers in the world in various strokes and their results (data cleaning, calculation and analysis of 10 KPIs)

2. A semiconductor industry process data set (SECOM) containing 590 features aims to reduce process costs and speed up the production process through data pre-processing, feature filtering, model building, and verification to achieve a PASS or FAIL prediction for the wafer.

3. The original database only has 24 sets of satellite images and corresponding roof position labels, through data augmentation, data pre-processing (split into training set, validation set, and test set), to build CNN-Unet model, and verify the accuracy of the model to achieve the goal of predicting the roof position in the test set of satellite images.
