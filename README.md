# Sabrina_ Portfolio

# Project 1: SECOM Analytics & Machine Learning (Ongoing)
 ● Implemented data mining of the semiconductor industry dataset (SECOM) with 590 features. 
 ● Interpreted and cleaned the data, and applied dimensionality reduction, preprocessing, visualization, and feature selection.
 ● Developed and evaluated multiple models to predict PASS or FAIL outcomes for wafers
 ● Aiming to reduce process costs and enhance production efficiency.
 
 
 
 

1. Analysis of the top 200 swimmers in the world in various strokes and their results (data cleaning, calculation and analysis of 10 KPIs)



3. The original database only has 24 sets of satellite images and corresponding roof location labels. Through data augmentation and data pre-processing (split into training set, inspection set, and test set), I built a CNN-Unet model (neural network), and verify the model accuracy to achieve the goal of predicting the roof location in the test set of satellite images.
